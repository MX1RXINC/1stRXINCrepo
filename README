So here is my first actual experiment of a verry low abstract using nothing but some good old fashion C++. Its a slightly modified version to experiment with the different abstract posibities and I know it is kind of hard to read. It is self contained. As you can see there are no extra or hidden .hpp files that yo need to locate anywhere on the web. It is pureley for learning purposes and it is modified from one of the books I am learning to program with.
